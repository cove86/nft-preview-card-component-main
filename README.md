## My process
I started by looking up some card components online, although I had created some myself during one of my courses I hadn't really created one without some sort of guidance before. I looked at how they were layed out within the HTML and where any divs needed to be. I decided that the whole card was one div and the card itself would be split into 3 (top, middle bottom). I started with the HTML and once I had all the content there, worked on getting the layout as i wanted in the CSS before finishing with the styling of the elements.


### Built with
- HTML
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned
Learned more about flex & grid, wasn't massively confident using them but am happy with what I achieved. Probably need to work on having a system for spacing to make it consistent and will need to work with box-shadow as had not done previously. There as more googling than I would have liked however I managed to find a lot of good resources for future reference!
